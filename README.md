control_out_v3: data generated by Python script + graphs 

test_out_v3: data generated by Python script + graphs + **Chi-Square-Test**

control_out_v4 and test_out_v4 are same as v3 counterparts except have p-values and U-values from U-test and DO NOT have the graphs or chi-square test

BIOL 389 - ERG test/control data contains all the raw data obtained by Clampfit.
main.py is the Python script used for the data extraction + statistical analysis (U-tests)

Control_out_data_v4 and test_out_data_v4 contain the data generated by the Python script related to
the mean depolarization per condition (protocol x color), per group (ninaE/test, control), average recoveries
and the standard deviations for both of them.

off_time_data contains the data extracted via the Python script that investiages the effects of varying
off-time for a given on-time. 

** IT should be noted that the p-values and U values reported in the files generated by the python script
are duplicated between identical conditions but for different groups (i.e. control, A, blue will have its
p-values and U-values reported separately than test, A, blue) but they are the same value as they are generated
from the same function. They are just reported twice.
